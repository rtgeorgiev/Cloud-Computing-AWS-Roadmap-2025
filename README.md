# Learning Roadmap to Get Started in Cloud Computing with AWS

Note that AWS has 200+ services, and you don't have to be proficient in all of them. This roadmap covers Cloud and IT fundamentals and a select list of services to help you get started.

## 1. Cloud Foundations

### What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud Computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet instead of using local servers. It offers reliable, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing services which include data storage, databases, applications, analytics, machine learning, and even setting up virtual servers. The biggest names providing cloud computing services are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and others. The main selling point is that you only pay for the services you use, helping you manage your expenses more effectively.

### Types of Cloud Computing
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are three types of cloud service models:
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Provides users with a resource-based service via virtualization technology, offering computing infrastructure, physical or (more often) virtual machines, and other resources.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Provides runtime environments for developing, testing, and managing applications, used for software development.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Provides on-demand software accessed via the internet, delivering a complete software solution on a pay-as-you-go basis.

### Public vs Private vs Hybrid Cloud
- **Public Cloud:** Resources are available to the general public over the internet. Examples: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure.
- **Private Cloud:** Resources are dedicated to a single organization, offering more control and privacy.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines private and public clouds for flexibility, security, and deployment options.

## 2. Networking

### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Amazon VPC lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network. It includes advanced security features like security groups and network access control lists.

### Subnets
Subnets are divisions of a VPCâ€™s IP address range. Each subnet must be associated with a route table to control traffic flow.

**Resources to learn more:**
- [Configuring Subnets in AWS VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/configure-subnets.html)

---

### Route Tables
Route tables are sets of rules (routes) that determine where network traffic is directed within your VPC.

**Resources to learn more:**
- [AWS VPC Route Table](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/vpc-route-table.html)

---

### Security Groups
Security groups act as virtual firewalls to control inbound and outbound traffic for your instances.

**Resources to learn more:**
- [AWS VPC Security Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-security-groups.html)

---

### Internet Gateway
An Internet Gateway enables bi-directional routing between a VPC and the internet.
